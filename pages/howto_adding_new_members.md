When a new person submits the application form, here's the procedure: (ATM Microsoft Forms doesn't support notifications when it's filled out, you have to check manually)


1. Read their application, and decide whether or not to let them in. At this point in time, nobody's been denied, and IMO (@markspolakovs) it should stay that way, unless the application is complete spam.

2. Invite them to the GitHub and Slack teams. At the time of writing, the admins for both are @HackerManiac (Vidminas) and @markspolakovs. (Hint: If you download the form's responses as an Excel file, you can find their email there.)

3. Send a brief introductory email. Below is a general template, but try to make it personal to their application, as nobody likes to see a generic templated email.

```
Dear **INSERT PERSON NAME HERE**,

You have been accepted to the eslcc (European School of Luxembourg Computer Club), congratulations!

You should have received two emails before this one, one inviting you to our GitHub organisation, and one to our Slack team.
If you haven't got them both, give it a minute, if they're still not there let me know.
Also, check your spam folder if you don't see the Slack email, it may have landed there.

**INSERT SOMETHING PERSONAL TO THEIR APPLICATION HERE.**

Again, thank you, and welcome!

For the eslcc,
Marks Polakovs
```

4. When they join Slack, send an introductory message. Ask them how much experience they have and what they hope to get from the eslcc. Start a conversation, and make it a little bit fun.
